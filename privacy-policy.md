Privacy Policy ‚Äî Kitchen Counter

Last updated: October 7, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Kitchen Counter (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome Extension, website, and related services (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).

By installing or using Kitchen Counter, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please uninstall the Extension.

1. Information We Collect
a. Data You Provide

We collect information that you voluntarily provide when using the Services, such as:

Recipes or grocery lists you manually enter or save

Email address (only if you opt into features like emailed lists or newsletters)

Feedback or support requests

We do not collect sensitive personal data such as payment information, location data, or passwords.

b. Automatically Collected Data

When you use Kitchen Counter, limited technical data may be collected automatically to improve the Extension, including:

Browser type and version

Extension version

Anonymous usage analytics (e.g., which features are used most)

Error logs or crash reports

This data is non-identifiable and helps us debug and enhance performance.

c. Local Data Storage

Most of your data (recipes, grocery lists, pantry items) is stored locally on your device using Chrome‚Äôs storage API.
We do not have access to this information unless you explicitly export or sync it via optional features.

d. Optional Cloud or Email Features

If you choose to use optional features that require cloud connectivity ‚Äî such as emailing your grocery list or syncing data ‚Äî we may temporarily process the following:

The content of your grocery list or recipes

Your email address (to send the list or updates)

These are transmitted securely via encrypted HTTPS requests and not shared with any third party beyond the service used to deliver them (e.g., Resend, Vercel, or email providers).

2. How We Use Information

We use collected data only for:

Operating and improving the Extension

Sending requested lists or summaries via email

Responding to support inquiries

Debugging performance and preventing abuse

We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.
We do not use your personal data for advertising or marketing unless you explicitly opt in.

3. Data Sharing

We may share limited data only in the following cases:

With service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery) ‚Äî solely to perform operational tasks on our behalf.

For legal reasons ‚Äî if required by law, regulation, or court order.

We do not share or sell your data to advertisers or marketers.

4. Cookies and Tracking

Kitchen Counter does not use cookies or third-party tracking scripts.
Anonymous analytics, if enabled, rely only on aggregate data that cannot personally identify you.

5. Permissions Used by the Extension

To function properly, Kitchen Counter may request the following Chrome permissions:

storage ‚Äî saves your data locally (recipes, lists, settings).

activeTab / tabs ‚Äî reads the current tab URL only when you explicitly activate the recipe parser.

scripting ‚Äî injects minimal scripts into the page only to extract recipe information at your request.

No other data is read, stored, or transmitted without your action.

6. Data Retention

Locally stored data remains until you clear it or uninstall the Extension.

Emails or cloud-synced data (if applicable) are deleted automatically after delivery or a short retention period (usually under 24 hours).

You may delete any locally saved data at any time via your Chrome settings.

7. Data Security

We use modern encryption (HTTPS/TLS) for all transmissions and industry-standard safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.
However, no online service is 100% secure, and you use Kitchen Counter at your own risk.

8. Children‚Äôs Privacy

Kitchen Counter is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn we‚Äôve done so, we will delete it promptly.

9. Your Rights

Depending on your region, you may have certain rights over your data:

Request a copy or deletion of your data

Withdraw consent for optional features

File a complaint with a data protection authority

To exercise these rights, contact us at mjtraf@gmail.com.

10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If significant changes are made, we‚Äôll update the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date and post the new version on our site.
Continued use after updates means you accept the revised Policy.
